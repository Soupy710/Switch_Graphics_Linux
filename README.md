# Switch_Graphics_Linux
A Simple script that switches between Hybrid (iGPU and Nvidia) and Intel mode

#Read this before running!
Please switch to CLI (Ctrl+Alt+F3) and run the above script. This is because the script restarts the gdm once the xorg config files are modified. 
Hence the program is KILLED BEFORE RESTARTING and hence crashes gdm from starting again.
